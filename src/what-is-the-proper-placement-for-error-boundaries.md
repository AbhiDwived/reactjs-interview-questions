236. ### What is the proper placement for error boundaries?
     The granularity of error boundaries usage is up to the developer based on project needs. You can follow either of these approaches,
     1. You can wrap top-level route components to display a generic error message for the entire application.
     2. You can also wrap individual components in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application.
