96. ### How to conditionally apply class attributes?

    You shouldn't use curly braces inside quotes because it is going to be evaluated as a string.

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className="btn-panel {this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}">
    ```

    Instead you need to move curly braces outside (don't forget to include spaces between class names):

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={'btn-panel ' + (this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden')}>
    ```

    _Template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <div className={`btn-panel ${this.props.visible ? 'show' : 'hidden'}`}>
    ```
