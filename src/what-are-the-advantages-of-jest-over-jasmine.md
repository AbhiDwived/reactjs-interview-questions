150. ### What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?

     There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:

     - Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.
     - Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.
     - Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.
     - Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via `jsdom`) so that your tests can be run on the command line.
     - Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.
