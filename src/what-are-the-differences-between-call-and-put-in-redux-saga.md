177. ### What are the differences between `call()` and `put()` in redux-saga?

     Both `call()` and `put()` are effect creator functions. `call()` function is used to create effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. `put()` function creates an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

     Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.

     ```javascript
     function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
       // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
       // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
       const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId);

       // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
       yield put({
         type: "FETCH_USER_SUCCESS",
         userData,
       });
     }
     ```
