13. ### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

    The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.

    **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

    ```javascript
    setState({ name: "John" }, () =>
      console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
    );
    ```
