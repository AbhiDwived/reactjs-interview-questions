97. ### What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

    The `react` package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The `react-dom` package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in `react-dom/server` we have _server-side rendering_ support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.
