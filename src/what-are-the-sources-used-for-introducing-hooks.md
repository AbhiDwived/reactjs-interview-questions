307. ### What are the sources used for introducing hooks?

     Hooks got the ideas from several different sources. Below are some of them,

     1. Previous experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository
     2. Community experiments with render prop APIs such as Reactions Component
     3. State variables and state cells in DisplayScript.
     4. Subscriptions in Rx.
     5. Reducer components in ReasonReact.
