174. ### How to structure Redux top level directories?

     Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:

     1. **Components**: Used for _dumb_ components unaware of Redux.
     2. **Containers**: Used for _smart_ components connected to Redux.
     3. **Actions**: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.
     4. **Reducers**: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.
     5. **Store**: Used for store initialization.

     This structure works well for small and medium size apps.
