278. ### What is the purpose of default value in context?

     The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them.

     Below code snippet provides default theme value as Luna.

     ```javascript
     const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
     ```
