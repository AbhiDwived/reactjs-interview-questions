256. ### When component props defaults to true?

     If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. This behavior is available so that it matches the behavior of HTML.

     For example, below expressions are equivalent,

     ```javascript
     <MyInput autocomplete />

     <MyInput autocomplete={true} />
     ```

     **Note:** It is not recommended to use this approach because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand (example, `{name}` which is short for `{name: name}`)
