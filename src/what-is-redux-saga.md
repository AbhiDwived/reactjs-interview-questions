175. ### What is redux-saga?

     `redux-saga` is a library that aims to make side effects (asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.

     It is available in NPM:

     ```console
     $ npm install --save redux-saga
     ```
