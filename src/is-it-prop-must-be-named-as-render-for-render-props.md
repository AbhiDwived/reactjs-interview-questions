290. ### Must prop be named as render for render props?

     Even though the pattern named render props, you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. i.e, Any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Lets take an example with the children prop for render props,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse
       children={(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     />
     ```

     Actually children prop doesn’t need to be named in the list of “attributes” in JSX element. Instead, you can keep it directly inside element,

     ```javascript
     <Mouse>
       {(mouse) => (
         <p>
           The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}
         </p>
       )}
     </Mouse>
     ```

     While using this above technique(without any name), explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes.

     ```javascript
     Mouse.propTypes = {
       children: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
     };
     ```
