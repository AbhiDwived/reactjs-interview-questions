182. ### What are Redux selectors and why to use them?

     _Selectors_ are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.

     For example, to get user details from the state:

     ```javascript
     const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;
     ```

     These selectors have two main benefits,

     1. The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
     2. The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes
