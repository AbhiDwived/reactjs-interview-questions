12. ### Why should we not update the state directly?

    If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

    ```javascript
    //Wrong
    this.state.message = "Hello world";
    ```

    Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

    ```javascript
    //Correct
    this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
    ```

    **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in _constructor_ or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.
