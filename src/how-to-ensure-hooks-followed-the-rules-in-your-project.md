228. ### How to ensure hooks followed the rules in your project?
     React team released an ESLint plugin called **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project using the below command,
     ```javascript
     npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next
     ```
     And apply the below config in your ESLint config file,
     ```javascript
     // Your ESLint configuration
     {
       "plugins": [
         // ...
         "react-hooks"
       ],
       "rules": {
         // ...
         "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"
       }
     }
     ```

     For example, the linter enforce proper naming convention for hooks. If you rename your custom hooks which as prefix "use" to something else then linter won't allow you to call built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect etc inside of your custom hook anymore.

     **Note:** This plugin is intended to use in Create React App by default.
