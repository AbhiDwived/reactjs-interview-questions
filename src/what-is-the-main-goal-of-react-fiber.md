29. ### What is the main goal of React Fiber?

    The goal of _React Fiber_ is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

    _from documentation_

    Its main goals are:

    1. Ability to split interruptible work in chunks.
    2. Ability to prioritize, rebase and reuse work in progress.
    3. Ability to yield back and forth between parents and children to support layout in React.
    4. Ability to return multiple elements from render().
    5. Better support for error boundaries.
