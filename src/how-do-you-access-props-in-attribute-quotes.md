94. ### How do you access props in attribute quotes?

    React (or JSX) doesn't support variable interpolation inside an attribute value. The below representation won't work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src="images/{this.props.image}" />
    ```

    But you can put any JS expression inside curly braces as the entire attribute value. So the below expression works:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={"images/" + this.props.image} />
    ```

    Using _template strings_ will also work:

    ```jsx harmony
    <img className="image" src={`images/${this.props.image}`} />
    ```
