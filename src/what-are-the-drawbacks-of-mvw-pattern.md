159. ### What are the drawbacks of MVW pattern?

     1. DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.
     2. Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.
     3. Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).
     4. No way to do undo (travel back in time) easily without adding so much extra code.
