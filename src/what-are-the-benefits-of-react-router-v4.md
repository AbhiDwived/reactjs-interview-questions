230. ### What are the benefits of React Router V4?

     Below are the main benefits of React Router V4 module,

     1. In React Router v4(version 4), the API is completely about components. A router can be visualized as a single component(`<BrowserRouter>`) which wraps specific child router components(`<Route>`).
     2. You don't need to manually set history. The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with `<BrowserRouter>` component.
     3. The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)
